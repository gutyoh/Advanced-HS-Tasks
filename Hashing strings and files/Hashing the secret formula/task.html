<p>[TITLE]Hashing the secret formula # Application[/TITLE]</p>

<p>Mr. Krabs 🦀 is tired of Plankton trying to steal his Krabby Patty 🍔 formula 📜 countless times! He wants to compute the hash value of the <em>secret_formula.txt</em>&nbsp;using the SHA-512 hashing algorithm.</p>

<p>Mr. Krabs 🦀 has already written the required code to open the <em>secret_formula.txt</em> file; your task is to help him write the additional required code to compute the SHA-512 hash value of the file.</p>
