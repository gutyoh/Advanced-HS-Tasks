<p>[TITLE]Favorite songs # Application[/TITLE]</p>

<p>Bruno has a file called <em>songs.txt</em> with all his favorite songs. He wants to open the file in his Go program to read the data from it and then print it to the console.</p>

<p>Bruno has already written the required to code print the file contents to the console; however, he forgot how to properly open the file! Please help Bruno write the additional required code to open <em>songs.txt</em> and store it within the <code>file</code> variable. Remember to implement error handling within the <code>if</code> statement.</p>

<p>[ALERT-primary]This problem uses the <code>bufio</code> package to scan the text contained within <em>songs.txt</em>. To solve this task, you don't need to know how the <code>bufio</code> package works. The only objective is to open <em>songs.txt</em>Â and implement error handling within the <code>if</code> statement.[/ALERT]</p>
